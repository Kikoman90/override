solution level08:

-> the program takes one filename as parameter

-> a log file is opened in write-mode, then the program tries to open the file with the filename we provided as argument for reading

-> next, the filename is appended to the "./backups/" string and a call to open is made with the resulting string as first parameter, and O_EXCL | O_CREAT | O_WRONLY as second parameter

-> if the call to open succeeded, the file that we opened in read mode is copied into the backup file located in the backups folder

-> the program has the setuid bit enabled so we can open and read the .pass file in the /home/users/level09 directory but if we set argv[1] to "/home/users/level09/.pass", the call to open with O_CREAT will fail because open will not create the entire directory hierarchy

-> therefore we use a symbolic link / soft link to the .pass file so that the backup file can be created without hassle

> pwd
/home/users/level08
> chmod 777 .
> ln -s /home/users/level09/.pass pass
> ./level08 pass
> cat ./backups/pass
