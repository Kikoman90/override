solution level07:

-> the program is a "number storage device" which allows three operations from the user: "store", "read", and "quit"

-> the main first sets the environment and the program arguments to 0 by iterating over pointers envp and argv. This in effect prevents us from storing a shellcode in the environment or arguments.

-> the main allocates on the stack an array of 100 integers

-> the main reads from stdin:
* if the user command is "store", it calls the function store_number
* if the user command is "read", it calls the function read_number
* if the user command is "quit", the program returns normally

-> the read_number function simply displays the number in the array at the index provided by the user

-> the store_number function asks for 2 numbers: the number the user wants to store, and the index at which he wants to store it
-> there are 2 conditions that we need to pass to write the number we want in the array
-> if we pass the condtions, the program writes the number by simply indexing into the array, which means we could technically overflow the array with an index bigger than 100

-> the return address of the main is at 0xffffd6cc and the address of our int buffer is 0xffffd504:
0xffffd6cc - 0xffffd504 = 0x1c8 (= 456 in decimal)
456 / 4 = 114 so we need to write at buffer[114] to overwrite the saved eip of main

-> if we try to write at index 114, the program displays an error message, because the first condition for storing a number is that the index must not be a multiple of 3

-> we are going to overwrite the return address of main with the address of system, while also writing the address of string "/bin/sh" at index 116 to perform a ret2libc exploit.

-> the address of system is 0xf7e6aed0 (4159090384) and the address of "/bin/sh" is 0xf7f897ec (4160264172)

-> we are prevented from writing at index 114 but we can bypass the modulo by 3 condition by setting the high order bit of the index to 1. This bit will be discarded because the index is right shifted once. Therefore writing at index 2147483762 is equivalent to writing at index 114.
