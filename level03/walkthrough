solution level03:

-> the program asks for user input : it fetches an integer with a call to scanf

-> the function "test" is then called, taking two parameters : our integer, and the constant '0x1337d00d'

-> "test" computes the difference between the 2 integers, and calls the function "decrypt" which takes an integer as parameter
if the difference is between 1 and 9, or between 16 and 21, "decrypt" is called with that difference as parameter
otherwise the parameter is a random number

-> "decrypt" declares the string "Q}|u`sfg~sf{}|a3" which we'll call "str"

-> for every character of "str", a xor operation is performed with the parameter/difference

-> finally if "str" is equal to "Congratulations!", a shell is open with the system method

-> we can find out what the integer of the xor operation should be :
(we want 'Q' to become 'C')

	'Q' = 0x51 = 01010001b
	'C' = 0x43 = 01000011b

	0101 0001  
      ^ 0001 0010 (= 0x12 = 18)
	0100 0011 

our difference should be 18, so the integer we provide to the program in the main is :
	0x1337d00d - 0x12 = 322424827
